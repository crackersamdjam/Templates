# Templates

Algorithm and data structure templates for competitive programming.

- C++ resources compile with g++ in C++17
- Python scripts run in Python 3
- Shell scripts run in Bash
- Fuzz tests test small cases (could be random) for correctness
- Stress tests test large random cases for performance

Todo:
- get everything to compile in C++17 and C++20 (other versions don't matter)
